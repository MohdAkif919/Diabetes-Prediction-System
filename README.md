# Overview

- Welcome to the **Diabetes Prediction System**, the second project of my internship at MeriSKILL.
  
- As a data analyst, I've developed this Python-based application to predict the likelihood of an individual having diabetes using machine learning techniques.

- The predictive model, built with scikit-learn's logistic regression, boasts an accuracy score of approximately 0.81. To make the system accessible and user-friendly, I've deployed it using Django, creating a local server for seamless interaction.

# Features

- **Machine Learning Model:** Utilizes logistic regression for diabetes prediction, achieving an accuracy score of approximately 0.81.

- **Web Application:** The model is deployed using Django, providing a user-friendly interface for input and displaying the prediction results.

# Libraries Used

- **[NumPy](https://numpy.org/):** Fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
   
- **[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/):** Data manipulation and analysis library.
   
- **[Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/):** Statistical data visualization.
   
- **[scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/):** Machine learning library for classification, regression, and clustering.
  
- **[joblib](https://joblib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/):** Library for lightweight pipelining in Python.
  
# Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MohdAkif919/Diabetes-Prediction-System.git
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Diabetes-Prediction-System

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

# Usage

1. Run the Django development server:

   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver

2. Access the application:
   - Open your web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/.

3. Input relevant features:
   - Fill out the form with the required information. This typically includes input fields for features such as age, BMI, blood pressure, etc.
     
4. Get the prediction:
   - Click the "Submit" button to send the input data to the machine learning model.
   - The system will then provide a prediction for the likelihood of diabetes based on the input values.

# Internship at MeriSKILL

This project serves as the second project in my internship at MeriSKILL, where I hold the position of a data analyst. I am excited to contribute to the organization's goals and further enhance my skills in data analysis.
